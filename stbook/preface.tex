\textcolor{red}{[The book introduces robust statistics in Stata from an
applied perspective. We review existing commands and present a variety of new
tools, give advice on how to choose among the different estimators and
illustrate how they can be applied in practice. After a general introduction
the book first discusses robust estimation of univariate location and scale
and, along the way, briefly introduces the basic concepts of robust statistics.
The book then moves on to simple and multiple robust regression and models for
qualitative dependent variables, each time reviewing (briefly) the theory,
presenting the algorithms, commands, and implementation details, and providing
applied examples. Furthermore, we discuss multivariate identification of
outliers and present robust versions of factor models] \dots}
